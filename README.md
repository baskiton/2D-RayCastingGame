# 2.5D RayCasting Game
This is a simple pseudo-3d walker.

The work of this program can be described in one screenshot:

#### Control with Mouse and Keyboard:
 * W, UpArrow - forward
 * S, DownArrow - backwards
 * A - left
 * D - right
 * LeftArrow - turn left
 * RightArrow - turn right
 * ESC - Exit dialog

Mouse control may be incorrect, so I recommend using the arrow-keys.

#### Install
To install this mini-game, download the [setup.exe](https://github.com/baskiton/2D-RayCastingGame/releases/tag/1.0) 
file and perform the installation at any place on the disk.

To start the game, go to the directory with the installed program and run GAME.exe

Enjoy! I will be happy for your comments!
